===================
Very simple mandelbrot set zoomer in Scala.

It's very far from being completed. I don't like Scala at all, so maybe I'll
never finish it. :)

How to build and Run
--------------------

1. Install [Java 8 JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) update 40 or newer.

2. Install [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/)

3. Run the example: change to directory containing this example and use SBT to
   build and run the example:

   ```
    %> sbt run
   ```

   It will download needed dependencies, including Scala and ScalaFX, and run 
   the example code.
